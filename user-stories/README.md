## ðŸ“˜ User Stories - Airbnb Clone Backend

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
The goal of this task was to translate the use case diagram interactions into actionable user stories. These stories represent the core functionalities that users (guests, hosts, and admins) need to perform on the platform.

User stories serve as the foundation for backend development, providing a user-centric perspective that guides API design, database modeling, and business logic implementation.

## ðŸ§© What We Did
Based on the use case diagram created in the previous task, we identified the main actors (Guest, Host, Admin) and their interactions with the system. We then translated each of these interactions into simple, understandable user stories.

# Each story follows the standard user story format:

* "As a [user], I want to [perform an action] so that I can [achieve a goal]."

This helps clarify why a feature is needed and what value it delivers to the user.
