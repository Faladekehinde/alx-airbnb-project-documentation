## 🏠 2. Property Management

### 🔧 **Functional Capabilities**

* Hosts can create, modify, or delete their property listings
* Retrieve all properties owned by a specific host

### 🌐 **API Routes**

* `POST /api/properties` — Create a new property listing
* `PUT /api/properties/:id` — Edit an existing property
* `DELETE /api/properties/:id` — Remove a property
* `GET /api/properties/host/:hostId` — View listings by a specific host

### 📤 **Example Request: Add Property**

```json
{
  "title": "Quillox",
  "location": "VI Lagos",
  "price": 4550,
  "amenities": ["club", "lounge", "air conditioning"]
}
```

### 📥 **Example Response**

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "message": "Property successfully added"
}
```

### ✅ **Validation Requirements**

* `title`: required, max 100 characters
* `price`: must be a positive numeric value

### 🚀 **Performance Optimization**

* Database indexes on `host_id` and `location` for faster querying

---

## 🔍 3. Property Discovery & Filters

### 🔧 **Functional Capabilities**

* Users can search properties by `location`, `price range`, and `amenities`
* Supports paginated responses for large result sets

### 🌐 **API Endpoint**

* `GET /api/properties/search`

**Sample Query:**

```
?location=paris&minPrice=100&maxPrice=200&amenities=wifi&limit=10&page=2
```

### 📥 **Example Response**

```json
{
  "properties": [...],
  "page": 2,
  "totalPages": 5
}
```

### 🚀 **Performance Optimization**

* Full-text search and Redis caching for high-demand search terms

---

## 📅 4. Booking Engine

### 🔧 **Functional Capabilities**

* Users can make, view, or cancel bookings
* Ensures booking conflicts are prevented for the same date range

### 🌐 **API Routes**

* `POST /api/bookings` — Place a booking
* `GET /api/bookings/user/:userId` — View a user's bookings
* `DELETE /api/bookings/:id` — Cancel a booking

### 📤 **Create Booking Request**

```json
{
  "userId": 2,
  "propertyId": 1,
  "checkIn": "2025-06-01",
  "checkOut": "2025-06-05"
}
```

### 📥 **Booking Response**

```json
{
  "bookingId": 12,
  "status": "confirmed"
}
```

### ✅ **Validation Rules**

* Booking dates must be in the future and `checkOut` must follow `checkIn`
* Property availability must be verified before confirming the booking

### 🚀 **Performance Optimization**

* Efficient queries for detecting overlapping bookings using date range logic

---

## 💳 5. Payment Processing

### 🔧 **Functional Capabilities**

* Handles secure payments through Stripe
* Automatically releases host earnings after booking is confirmed

### 🌐 **API Route**

* `POST /api/payments`

### 📤 **Payment Request Example**

```json
{
  "bookingId": 12,
  "paymentMethodId": "pm_xxx",
  "amount": 450.00
}
```

### 📥 **Payment Response**

```json
{
  "paymentId": "pay_123456",
  "status": "successful"
}
```

### ✅ **Validation Rules**

* Ensure the user owns the booking before processing payment
* Payment amount must align with booking cost

### 🚀 **Performance Optimization**

* Use of asynchronous background jobs (queues) for delayed payouts and webhooks

---

## 🌟 6. Ratings & Reviews

### 🔧 **Functional Capabilities**

* Guests can provide feedback for completed stays
* Hosts can respond publicly to guest reviews

### 🌐 **API Routes**

* `POST /api/reviews` — Add a review
* `POST /api/reviews/:id/reply` — Host replies to a review

### 📤 **Review Submission Example**

```json
{
  "bookingId": 12,
  "rating": 4,
  "comment": "Great place!"
}
```

### 📥 **Review Response**

```json
{
  "reviewId": 20,
  "message": "Review successfully posted"
}
```

### ✅ **Validation Rules**

* Reviews can only be submitted after the stay has ended
* Ratings must be integers between 1 and 5

### 🚀 **Performance Optimization**

* Indexes on `property_id` to speed up review aggregation and listing
